# SPAWC2021-InsectorCS
This repository contains the MATLAB codes for the simulation results in
H. Masoumi, N. J. Myers, G. Leus, S. Wahls, and M. Verhaegen, “Structured sensing matrix design for in-sector compressed mmwave channel estimation,” in Proc. IEEE Intl. Workshop Signal Process. Adv. Wireless Commun. (SPAWC), pp. 1–5, 2022.

You may run "Rate_vs_SNR.m" to obtain the data for Fig. 5 in the paper. Also, you can use "Rate_vs_SNR.m" to obtain the data for Fig. 4 in the paper. 

To produce the plots you may use "main_plot.m".

"HH.mat" contains 100 channel realizations obtained from the NYU channel simulator.
